<p>One of the most special things that sets humans apart from other animals is that we not only act on instinct, but also rely on the ability to think and perceive. In real life, all of our activities are through the thinking of the brain. We always think, plan when starting to do something.</p>



<p>From that, it is evident that the result of thinking has a tremendous impact on our behavior and work methods, the effectiveness of what we do depends a great deal on thinking. So, what is logical thinking, its role, and methods of training logical thinking?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-what-is-logic-thinking"><strong>1. What is logic thinking.</strong></h2>



<p>Logical thinking is the process by which human beings analyze, reason, evaluate information, and string together information to create systematic connections based on their own knowledge, experience, evidence, and real-life events to solve problems at work and make decisions in life.</p>



<p>Logical thinking helps people to build for themselves a system of analysis, argumentation, and speculation, thereby making decisions that help achieve desired results.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-the-role-of-logical-thinking-in-life">2. The role of logical thinking in life.</h2>



<p>It can be affirmed that logical thinking plays a crucial role in all success. Every day, we use logical thinking to participate in activities.</p>



<p>It supports people to analyze information in a logical and systematic way. By looking at the issue from many different angles, we will gather the necessary data and information, from which we can clearly identify the problem.</p>



<p>From there, we can infer, link those elements together in a systematic way, based on criteria to find solutions to the problem.</p>



<p>In addition, you also have the ability to assess the risks, feasibility, and effectiveness of the solutions you consider. From there, you can choose a method to limit risks and still achieve your goals.</p>



<p>For example, when we go to the supermarket to buy things with a certain amount of money, we will need to list the items to buy, and consider which items are expensive or cheap, what is the quality of it to choose to buy or not, in order to still buy necessary items without exceeding the amount of money that can be spent.</p>



<p>Or, when you have an exam next week, instead of burying yourself in studying everything from now on without any order, any topic, before studying, you will arrange the knowledge by topic, learn about the test layout to know where to focus on and allocate time for the exam properly.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p><strong><strong>The essence of logical thinking is to interpret a result or solve a problem in a logical way, thereby standardizing that process into problems and formulas of your own.</strong></strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Similar to when you study math, you learn about distance formulas, velocity calculations, or calculus formulas, integrals. You study theorems, etc.</p>



<p>For example: for a, b, c as the 3 sides of a triangle, if the sum of the squares of any 2 sides equals the square of the remaining side, then the triangle is a right-angled triangle. Or when you encounter problems related to integration, just apply the correct mindset and integration formulas, and you&#8217;ll get the result.</p>



<p>When encountering a problem, you just need to identify its type and then apply the correct formula and approach for that type of problem to obtain the correct result. The more you practice, the higher your experience and skills will be, and you will find it easier to solve.</p>



<p>The only difference is that the formulas you learn have been proven by others and are specifically clear by type. In life, the problems you encounter are not only confined to a specific topic, and unexpected factors may arise, moreover, your formulas have not been proven by anyone yet and you have to prove it yourself, at least for yourself.</p>



<p>So you need to always use logical thinking to detect the flaws in your formula, then make corrections, arguments, proceed logically, prove based on facts so that you can find the most comprehensive formula that is right for you.</p>



<p>From there, you will find your own recipes for success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-methods-for-training-logical-thinking-ability">3. Methods for training logical thinking ability.</h2>



<p>Logical thinking is not an innate talent, but a skill that can be trained and developed. Like any other part of the body, the brain also needs to be trained daily to become more independent, agile, and logical.</p>



<p>Therefore, to improve our logical thinking abilities, we can apply the following methods to train logical thinking.</p>



<div id="always-start-with-the-questions-why-and-how" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="always-start-with-the-questions-why-and-how">Always start with the questions &#8220;Why?&#8221; and &#8220;How?&#8221;.</h3>



<p>These questions are like signs. When you ask yourself these, it means your brain understands that it needs to think and interpret that process logically in order to determine the cause and the process of problem formation clearly.</p>



<p><strong>&#8211; Why:</strong> This question will help you understand the cause or reason behind an issue or decision. In this way, you can analyze the logical basis and determine the relationship between different factors.</p>



<p><strong>&#8211; How:</strong> This question will help you focus on the process or method to carry out a task or achieve a goal. It requires you to think about the specific steps, procedure, or method to solve a problem.</p>



<p>The more you want to know clearly, in detail why and how your brain needs to think logically more, the more you know what you have to do, the more you understand the process of creating that problem.</p>



<p>From there, you will find the <strong>formula</strong> and can customize it to achieve the results you desire.</p>



<div id="improve-your-own-knowledge" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="improve-your-own-knowledge">Improve your own knowledge.</h3>



<p><code>You have more knowledge, your understanding of the issues you need to solve increases. The more information you have, the more tightly linked and logical you can create, thereby generating more new and effective methods.</code></p>



<p>In addition, improving your knowledge also helps broaden your mind, stimulates brain activity, leads to new ways of thinking, new perspectives, and enhances your creativity.</p>



<p>You can broaden your knowledge by reading books, stories, watching movies, playing games, and learning new skills. There are plenty of book genres, stories, movies, games, or new skills for you to choose from, so just pick the genre you like.</p>



<p>No matter what the genre, what matters is that you always remember to ask the question <strong>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220;How?&#8221;</strong> whenever you have a question during that process, try to think and answer it. That process will make your brain actively work, which means you constantly have to think logically.</p>



<p>From then on, your logical thinking abilities will continuously improve, and you will also gain more valuable information.</p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t know what to read or learn, don&#8217;t worry, consider it a problem and ask &#8220;Why?&#8221; and &#8220;How?&#8221; Then you will find a way to solve the problem, and that is also the process that helps you develop logical thinking.</p>



<p>The more detailed information you have about the issue, the deeper your understanding of it will be, and the more perspectives and methods you will have to solve the problem. From there, you can come up with a suitable plan and course of action to resolve it.</p>



<p>Similar to what was written in The Art of War.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>To know oneself is true progress.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<div id="develop-logical-thinking-through-debate-and-exchange" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="develop-logical-thinking-through-debate-and-exchange">Develop logical thinking through debate and exchange.</h3>



<p>When you participate in discussions and exchanges, people often consider what they say to be right and present evidence, reasoning, analysis, and strong arguments to defend their opinions or refute the opinions of others.</p>



<p>And so are you, there are things that you believe to be right but there will be people who do not believe, reject your opinion. Trying to prove and persuade others of the correctness of what you put forward will greatly enhance your logical thinking ability.</p>



<p>In addition, exposing yourself to various perspectives, thoughts, and different <strong>formulas</strong> will also help you gain more insights, expand your knowledge, and broaden your mind.</p>



<p>At the same time, it also enhances your communication skills and knowledge of how to listen and understand others&#8217; perspectives, helping you to be more flexible and proactive when encountering and dealing with different issues.</p>



<div id="train-logical-thinking-through-real-life-experiences-and-issues" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="train-logical-thinking-through-real-life-experiences-and-issues">Train logical thinking through real-life experiences and issues.</h3>



<p>The most effective way to train logical thinking is none other than the process of solving problems in your own life and the real experiences you go through. Thinking is not just confined to books, to theories, but is also developed through practical actions.</p>



<p>When you experience things on your own terms, you will develop knowledge and perspectives for yourself. At the same time, it will also help you gain skills and insights that you would never understand just by thinking alone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-conclusion">4. Conclusion.</h2>



<p>No one knows everything since birth, so they have to seek, strive to learn, explore, develop and enhance their logical thinking skills and other skills, from which they will surpass others by 10 times, 100 times. Only then can they be called a genius.</p>



<p>So keep striving to train, training logical thinking, and one&#8217;s own skills will help you become more agile, confident, and proficient in life, helping you shorten the time to achieve your goals.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The reason why most people never achieve "wealth" is because they don't truly understand the meaning of "wealth". So what is the true meaning.....]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-true-meaning-wealth-elliot-begoun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>Most people, when they mention <strong>&#8220;wealth</strong>&#8220;, understand that wealth means having a lot of money, valuable assets, etc. And they often have love or hate for wealth.</p>



<p>Some people feel angry towards those who have money, but spend their whole life trying to earn as much money as they do. The reason most people never achieve &#8220;wealth&#8221; is because they do not truly understand <strong>the</strong> <strong>true meaning of wealth.</strong></p>



<p><strong><strong>So what is the true meaning of wealth?</strong></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-85cb735216735f84eecce86fecb2838d" style="font-size:28px"><strong>1. &#8220;Wealthy&#8221; is when you no longer need to make an effort to earn money to sustain your daily life.</strong></h2>



<p>When you don&#8217;t need to go to work to make money from a job day in and day out, but still can live comfortably. To put it bluntly, you can go to bed without doing anything and still have money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="674" src="./../../wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1355" srcset="./../../wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-3.png 1024w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-3-300x197.png 300w, ./../../wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-3-768x506.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="has-contrast-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-e9b5ff519c10bfaaf05cee54b4f296b4" style="background-color:#d0cdcd"><strong><strong>So where does the money come from?</strong></strong></p>



<p>The amount comes from the things that help you make money even when you sleep, meaning from your passive income sources.</p>



<p>Passive income sources can come from:</p>



<ul>
<li> bank interest rates</li>



<li> advertising from videos on youtube, personal websites, …</li>



<li> selling digital products such as: audio, beats, ebooks, websites, &#8230;</li>



<li> investment items such as stock investment, digital currency, …</li>
</ul>



<p>Those are the specific jobs that require direct involvement in order to earn money, such as being a wage laborer, an employee, etc. These are your active sources of income. These jobs require you to exchange your health and time for money. If you no longer do these jobs, then for sure you will have no more money.</p>



<p>But our time and health are limited, you can&#8217;t work forever, so if you want to become &#8220;rich,&#8221; you need to find activities, things that can help you generate passive income.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8220;Depending on the amount of money that makes you feel happy with life,<br>create passive income sources for yourself so that they always exceed that amount of expenses.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Example:</strong> <br>+ Suppose you only need 15 million VND per month, then you can live comfortably and feel happy with life. Therefore, you need to create a passive income greater than 15 million VND per month, and then you will have found wealth for yourself.</p>



<p>+ If, for example, someone needs to spend 200 million per month to achieve the happiness they desire, then that person will need to generate a passive income greater than 200 million per month in order to become wealthy.</p>



<p>And an undeniable fact is that if you spend more than you earn, the only result you will achieve is debt and borrowing.</p>



<p><strong><strong>=&gt; Being wealthy means that your passive income must exceed the amount you need to spend to help you feel happy with life.</strong></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8625d55e83fd8f51c86c5c43fe989e81"><strong>2. Happiness is Wealth</strong>.</h2>



<p>Ultimately, the desire for wealth is aimed at improving one&#8217;s quality of life, to alleviate worries about paying for electricity, rent, and daily expenses, to have the freedom to buy things one truly enjoys without constantly worrying about the cost, and to be able to provide the best for beloved family and friends.</p>



<p><strong><strong>=&gt; To make your life more meaningful, happier.</strong></strong></p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have to become as wealthy as someone else, you don&#8217;t have to make as much money as they do to become rich. What you need is to know how much is enough to make you feel happy.</p>



<p>The rich and the successful, they all know their goals, they understand themselves, know what they truly like, and how much is enough for them.</p>



<p>Based on my interviews and research on wealthy individuals, there are many affluent people who lead a very simple lifestyle, and this <strong>accounts for over 80%</strong> of such individuals in the wealthy community. For example: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Amancio Ortega, and so on.</p>



<p>But there are many people with not very high salaries who still want to buy luxury clothing, expensive handbags, spending on impulsive desires, therefore it almost does not bring value to the development but only makes you always in a state of lack of money, out of money.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not saying that they are wealthy, they don&#8217;t use money, but one thing for sure is that they spend a lot, however, <strong>the amount they spend is always less than the amount of their passive income</strong>.</p>



<p>And especially, they do not spend money on things that they see as not helpful in their lives, desires that are impulsive, on the contrary, they will definitely spend generously on what they need, what they really like, what helps them develop themselves and increase their passive income stream.</p>



<p>By understanding their own lives, their personalities, and their tastes, they can minimize spending on unnecessary things and maximize spending on other essential needs to become more developed. That is one of the reasons why the rich get richer.</p>



<p><strong>=&gt; When you understand your own personality, your current life, and the life you desire in the future, that&#8217;s when you will find happiness, and that is also the wealth you desire.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c2bbabbd8ee382c26a9c9d4f3821e74d">*** <strong><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</strong></h2>



<p>I think by now, you all understand what I am aiming for. Now, I believe each of you has a definition of &#8220;wealth&#8221; that you want to achieve in the future. It&#8217;s not about seeking the wealth of others, but about seeking your own wealth.</p>

<p>I have had a period of feeling lost in life because I didn&#8217;t know what my purpose was. During that time, I was constantly overthinking, which led to frustration, exhaustion, mental depletion, and a lack of energy to do anything else.</p>



<p>Day after day, I find myself immersed in thoughts about myself, not knowing what I truly like, not knowing what my goals and dreams are, and not knowing how to understand myself better.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">That made me feel lost, tired, exhausted, not wanting to interact, talk to other people. Every day I isolate myself more, I don&#8217;t understand myself, and then I don&#8217;t want to make any effort to do anything else in life, when I&#8217;m so exhausted I just fall asleep.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">My life keeps repeating itself, and gradually I feel like it doesn&#8217;t have any meaning.</p>



<p>Only when there are unforeseen events, things that I did not expect, things that appear new in my life, it turns my previous life upside down, making me feel things that I had never experienced in my previous life.</p>



<p>After going through all that, I realized that my life is meaningful in many ways. I finally understood that the things I have been thinking about all along, the answers I needed have always been right in front of me, I just didn&#8217;t realize it back then.</p>



<p>Now I know how to understand myself better, find goals, and dreams that I want to pursue.</p>



<p>I think many of you, like me, have experienced a period of feeling lost, not knowing &#8220;who I am&#8221;. But eventually, you have found the answers to those questions, understood yourselves better, and found a happy life.</p>



<p>But there are also many people who are currently stuck in that cycle, sinking into their own thoughts without being able to escape, and then their spirits become weakened and no longer want to do anything else. Gradually losing themselves, being wrapped up in others, and enduring that life even though they don&#8217;t feel happy.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why I wrote this blog with the desire to share a journey that helped me understand myself better, which I realized during that difficult time. I hope that what I share here will help you somewhat in understanding yourself better, helping you find value in your own life.</p>

<p>Imagine your life as a painting, if the things you are seeking are not present in that painting, you will never find them. Or if those things have not yet taken on a specific form and are only at the sketching stage, you will not recognize them either.</p>



<p>That is why, seek additional ideas and sources of inspiration from other paintings, from outside of your painting, to envision many possibilities for your artwork. Add different colors to &#8220;your painting,&#8221; these colors could be:</p>



<p>+ New friends.<br>+ New knowledge.<br>+ New activities.<br>+ Things that you&#8217;ve never tried before.</p>



<p>( And of course, without violating the law ;3 )</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t worry about whether you like it or not, because what you need to do is <strong>stop thinking</strong> and <strong>just give it a try</strong>. All of those things will make your &#8220;picture&#8221; messy and not as it used to be.</p>



<p>Those things will help you have new thoughts, new perspectives, and new feelings about things that you would never see if you always stayed in your old life.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">If you continue to maintain a life like that,<br>then what you receive will not change.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So do not let laziness, difficulties, hesitation, and fear prevent you from stepping out of your current life, to seek new things in life, to understand yourself better, to find your own worth, to find your own happiness.</p>

<div id="2-1-what-will-happen-when-you-no-longer-spend-time-for-yourself" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-1-what-will-happen-when-you-no-longer-spend-time-for-yourself"><strong>2.1. <strong>What will happen when you no longer spend time for yourself?</strong> </strong></h3>



<p>After experiencing many things you have never felt before. The joys you have never had, the pains you have never suffered, meeting people with a very beautiful &#8220;painting&#8221; and also people who cannot even have a complete piece of paper for their &#8220;painting&#8221;. Then you realize that your previous life was so boring.</p>



<p>And at the same time, you will also realize that there are too many things in this life that you want, you will be swept away by those fleeting desires, you will be wrapped up in the beauty of other &#8220;paintings,&#8221; and then you will have no time for your own painting, and once again you will be lost in a pile of chaotic things.</p>



<p>Gradually, you will forget the person inside yourself, forgetting the things that make you truly happy in life, to pursue fleeting emotions and pleasures.</p>



<p>And then at some point in the future, you will realize that you have wasted time, health, and money on things that are not worth the value you have put into them, and then you will feel very regretful about it.</p>



<div id="2-2-the-things-you-gain-when-talking-listening-to-yourself" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-2-the-things-you-gain-when-talking-listening-to-yourself"><strong>2.2. <strong>The things you gain when talking, listening to yourself.</strong>.</strong></h3>



<p>That&#8217;s why, whenever you experience something, always take a moment to dedicate some time for yourself during the day, in a quiet environment, where there is only you and yourself, to talk, to tell yourself what you have been through.</p>



<p>At this time, just say what you think, speak of what you experience, both the happy and the sad, express your doubts, what makes you upset, don&#8217;t hide anything because you are talking to yourself. Speak out loud, or you can write it down on paper and read it.</p>



<p>What you recount is also how your brain is shaping, rearranging what you are thinking, experiencing, and from that, you will gain insights, find answers to things that puzzle you.</p>



<p>In addition, you should relax your body and mind, contemplate, think about the things you&#8217;ve been through, and then you will feel the most genuine emotions from within yourself. That&#8217;s how you can talk and listen to yourself.</p>



<p>Listening to yourself will help you understand what you like, what you hate, what is best for you, what is harmful to you, your strengths, your weaknesses, your dreams, your goals, what truly brings you happiness. From there, you will have your own perspective and will not be pushed around by life indefinitely.</p>



<p>In other words, it will help you understand yourself better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-open-up-and-share-your-thoughts-with-someone-you-trust"><strong>3. Open up and share your thoughts with someone you trust.</strong></h2>



<p>This is quite similar to talking to yourself, with the only difference being that instead of speaking to yourself, you are conversing with someone else. This someone else could be your friends, family, your significant other, someone who makes you feel comfortable and close when talking, someone you trust.</p>



<p>When talking to yourself, you can take the time to self-analyze, contemplate life, and process emotions in private. But when speaking to others, you can share your emotions, thoughts, life, and experiences with the person in front of you.</p>



<p>In addition, the person you share with will also listen, share their own stories, thoughts, perspectives, knowledge, and provide sincere advice for you.</p>



<p>From there, you will have new perspectives, you will learn about the hidden corners of yourself that you have never realized before, those things will help you a lot in understanding yourself better.</p>



<p>Not only that, sharing and confiding with each other will also help both of them understand each other better, making their relationship closer and more intimate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-foster-your-imagination-and-creativity"><strong>4. <strong>Foster your imagination and creativity</strong>.</strong></h2>



<p>Cultivating your imagination and creativity is crucial because as you understand yourself better and learn more about different aspects of yourself, your imagination and creativity are what will help you develop and explore all the great potential within you.</p>



<p>It is what makes you enjoy what you are doing even more, making your goals clearer and more meaningful.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s something that helps you to find new methods, new ways of thinking, and new changes that quickly help you achieve your goals.</p>



<p>And at the same time, this will also create more new and interesting things for you in your life. It allows you to imagine the new things that you can add to your own &#8220;picture&#8221;.</p>



<p>When you have ideas, just start working on them. Those actions will help you gain new experiences, new perspectives, and that is exactly the first thing I told you above<br>&#8220;<strong>1. Add new things to your &#8220;painting</strong>&#8220;.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6a0bed85b9ca92539cc064d67a549931" id="conclusion"><strong>*** <strong>Conclusion</strong></strong></h2>



<p>Understanding oneself is a process similar to learning, and this process will never end. It will continue to repeat, because every time we learn new things, as time passes and our age changes, as society changes and affects our lives, our thoughts and desires also change accordingly.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why we need to constantly repeat that process to understand ourselves better, then we will never lose ourselves.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After a period of internship in the Sales of business, I have gained many values that the business department brings.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With a background in economics, doing an internship early on has always been a &#8220;thorny issue&#8221; for me when I first stepped into the university environment. After a first semester of being aimless and directionless, I was determined to do an internship in the second semester. Anything office-related would do as I was so &#8220;thirsty&#8221; for experience. I chose to intern in the sales departments  because as an economics student, I firmly believe that it would be difficult for me to produce any goods. Skills in marketing and product circulation would be most suitable and help me develop in the long term.</p>



<p>So what values that sales departments have I gained during my time with the company and the job?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-sales-experience"><strong>1. Sales experience</strong></h2>



<p>Experience is surely the top priority for every student, and I am no exception. I was so eager for experience that I went to many places to apply for unpaid internships in exchange for the guidance from more experienced people. Naturally, I was rejected many times, but fortunately, I ended up where I am working now.</p>



<p>Professional skills and soft skills are two core values that I receive:</p>



<div id="1-1-professional-skills" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-1-professional-skills">1.1. <strong><strong>Professional Skills:</strong></strong></h3>



<p>The sales position teaches me practical knowledge and a deeper understanding than what is taught in the &#8220;Business Management&#8221; and &#8220;Basic Marketing&#8221; books. It&#8217;s completely different from just reading and feeling vague and distant when not working.</p>



<p>Working experience also helps me understand more about the enterprise, how the business operates, and gain a basic understanding of the work of different departments within the company.</p>



<p>I have been studying human analysis tools such as numerology, DISC, … to gain a deeper understanding and improve myself, as well as to advise and support customers in guiding and overcoming difficulties in learning, and life issues.</p>



<p>I have the opportunity to learn about and get involved in Marketing, a field that I have always liked and nurtured for a long time.</p>



<div id="1-2-soft-skills" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-2-soft-skills">1.2. <strong><strong>Soft skills:</strong></strong></h3>



<p><strong>+ Communication</strong>: I have improved my communication skills through conversations with clients, managers, and colleagues. My job has pushed me to step out of my comfort zone, actively connect and engage. Communication is an art, skillful communication will support me and my colleagues in work and life, as my boss once taught me &#8220;the mouth helps the hands and feet&#8221;, truly impressive and revealing. Not only in work negotiations, but also in personal relationships such as family, friends, and partners, I have learned to regulate emotions, communicate skillfully to discuss issues and find solutions as well as general communication, instead of having to endure or create conversations that end in arguments and toxicity.</p>



<p><strong>+ Self-management: </strong>Unlike the dull energy lying in dorm room 1, scrolling through the phone all day, when I go to work, interact with the new environment, new friends, and new colleagues, I feel the energy of everyone, also &#8220;absorb&#8221; excitement and consciously push myself to study well, manage time.</p>



<p><strong>+ Time management:</strong>&nbsp;It&#8217;s still a story from semester 1, studying only 4 subjects but always feeling lacking and suffocated, all because of too much free time and laziness, &#8220;spending time on useless things and lacking time for necessary things.&#8221; Until starting to work, meeting those senior colleagues, those friends who also balanced study and work very well, received scholarships regularly every semester, won in various competitions, only then did I feel the pressure to arrange and be aware of studying to not fall behind. Now, I not only make a to-do list for each day, but also need to plan for the whole month, also thankful for the nature of the job that helped me learn how to improve myself.</p>



<p><strong>+</strong> <strong>Gratitude:</strong>&nbsp;Before going to work, I was involved in a volunteer club and initially felt overwhelmed by the strict rules. However, when I started working, learning about gratitude culture and expressing thanks, I became much more proactive, showing more gratitude and admiration for those who have led and taught me. I learned the mindset of &#8220;an empty cup,&#8221; accepting the teachings of others rather than acting like &#8220;I already know half of it,&#8221; as in the past.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-networking"><strong>2. Networking</strong></h2>



<p>I am connected and working with experienced mentors, both in work and life, people that I would never have the chance to contact if I didn&#8217;t go to work.</p>



<p>I have added truly quality and sustainable relationships when accompanying each other in work and development, those who are willing to listen and help when I need, those intimate &#8220;boards of directors&#8221; like family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-salary"><strong>3. Salary</strong></h2>



<p>I receive a salary that matches my dedication, and going to work early makes me value money early, value my parents&#8217; labor, and spend more reasonably.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-understanding-the-industry-better-instead-of-being-bogged-down-by-prejudices-from-the-past"><strong>4. Understanding the industry better instead of being bogged down by prejudices from the past</strong></h2>



<p>Employees of the sales department, the name of this position is Sale. Most people have stereotypes about sales, and I was like that too, but I decided to try it out to see what really suits me, and I have received a lot of values like the above &#8211; something that if I just stick with a biased mindset, I will never receive.</p>



<p>Sales is an essential part of business, and being a best seller is highly valuable in the eyes of employers. From my experience, there is no bad industry; every profession is worthwhile and contributes to social development. The difference lies in each person&#8217;s way of working. Being a caring salesperson, accompanying and supporting customers throughout the use of the service or product, to help them achieve the best results, is a very humane job. My quality networking includes not only colleagues and bosses, but also the customers I have advised and supported.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">*** <strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After nearly 1 year of perseverance, I went from being an Intern to a Supervisor. I am grateful to the colleague who guided me to this job, thankful for the mentors who provided guidance and instruction, appreciative of the teammates who worked alongside me to achieve our goals, and thankful to myself for persevering without giving up.</p>



<p>If you are also an economist, then the position in the business department is worth applying for and experiencing as well as developing yourself.</p>
