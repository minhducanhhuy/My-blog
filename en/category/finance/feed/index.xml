					<description><![CDATA[The reason why most people never achieve "wealth" is because they don't truly understand the meaning of "wealth". So what is the true meaning.....]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-true-meaning-wealth-elliot-begoun" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>Most people, when they mention <strong>&#8220;wealth</strong>&#8220;, understand that wealth means having a lot of money, valuable assets, etc. And they often have love or hate for wealth.</p>



<p>Some people feel angry towards those who have money, but spend their whole life trying to earn as much money as they do. The reason most people never achieve &#8220;wealth&#8221; is because they do not truly understand <strong>the</strong> <strong>true meaning of wealth.</strong></p>



<p><strong><strong>So what is the true meaning of wealth?</strong></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-85cb735216735f84eecce86fecb2838d" style="font-size:28px"><strong>1. &#8220;Wealthy&#8221; is when you no longer need to make an effort to earn money to sustain your daily life.</strong></h2>



<p>When you don&#8217;t need to go to work to make money from a job day in and day out, but still can live comfortably. To put it bluntly, you can go to bed without doing anything and still have money.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="674" src="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1355" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-3.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-3-300x197.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-3-768x506.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="has-contrast-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-elements-e9b5ff519c10bfaaf05cee54b4f296b4" style="background-color:#d0cdcd"><strong><strong>So where does the money come from?</strong></strong></p>



<p>The amount comes from the things that help you make money even when you sleep, meaning from your passive income sources.</p>



<p>Passive income sources can come from:</p>



<ul>
<li> bank interest rates</li>



<li> advertising from videos on youtube, personal websites, …</li>



<li> selling digital products such as: audio, beats, ebooks, websites, &#8230;</li>



<li> investment items such as stock investment, digital currency, …</li>
</ul>



<p>Those are the specific jobs that require direct involvement in order to earn money, such as being a wage laborer, an employee, etc. These are your active sources of income. These jobs require you to exchange your health and time for money. If you no longer do these jobs, then for sure you will have no more money.</p>



<p>But our time and health are limited, you can&#8217;t work forever, so if you want to become &#8220;rich,&#8221; you need to find activities, things that can help you generate passive income.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8220;Depending on the amount of money that makes you feel happy with life,<br>create passive income sources for yourself so that they always exceed that amount of expenses.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Example:</strong> <br>+ Suppose you only need 15 million VND per month, then you can live comfortably and feel happy with life. Therefore, you need to create a passive income greater than 15 million VND per month, and then you will have found wealth for yourself.</p>



<p>+ If, for example, someone needs to spend 200 million per month to achieve the happiness they desire, then that person will need to generate a passive income greater than 200 million per month in order to become wealthy.</p>



<p>And an undeniable fact is that if you spend more than you earn, the only result you will achieve is debt and borrowing.</p>



<p><strong><strong>=&gt; Being wealthy means that your passive income must exceed the amount you need to spend to help you feel happy with life.</strong></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8625d55e83fd8f51c86c5c43fe989e81"><strong>2. Happiness is Wealth</strong>.</h2>



<p>Ultimately, the desire for wealth is aimed at improving one&#8217;s quality of life, to alleviate worries about paying for electricity, rent, and daily expenses, to have the freedom to buy things one truly enjoys without constantly worrying about the cost, and to be able to provide the best for beloved family and friends.</p>



<p><strong><strong>=&gt; To make your life more meaningful, happier.</strong></strong></p>



<p>You don&#8217;t have to become as wealthy as someone else, you don&#8217;t have to make as much money as they do to become rich. What you need is to know how much is enough to make you feel happy.</p>



<p>The rich and the successful, they all know their goals, they understand themselves, know what they truly like, and how much is enough for them.</p>



<p>Based on my interviews and research on wealthy individuals, there are many affluent people who lead a very simple lifestyle, and this <strong>accounts for over 80%</strong> of such individuals in the wealthy community. For example: Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Warren Buffett, Amancio Ortega, and so on.</p>



<p>But there are many people with not very high salaries who still want to buy luxury clothing, expensive handbags, spending on impulsive desires, therefore it almost does not bring value to the development but only makes you always in a state of lack of money, out of money.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not saying that they are wealthy, they don&#8217;t use money, but one thing for sure is that they spend a lot, however, <strong>the amount they spend is always less than the amount of their passive income</strong>.</p>



<p>And especially, they do not spend money on things that they see as not helpful in their lives, desires that are impulsive, on the contrary, they will definitely spend generously on what they need, what they really like, what helps them develop themselves and increase their passive income stream.</p>



<p>By understanding their own lives, their personalities, and their tastes, they can minimize spending on unnecessary things and maximize spending on other essential needs to become more developed. That is one of the reasons why the rich get richer.</p>



<p><strong>=&gt; When you understand your own personality, your current life, and the life you desire in the future, that&#8217;s when you will find happiness, and that is also the wealth you desire.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-c2bbabbd8ee382c26a9c9d4f3821e74d">*** <strong><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</strong></h2>



<p>I think by now, you all understand what I am aiming for. Now, I believe each of you has a definition of &#8220;wealth&#8221; that you want to achieve in the future. It&#8217;s not about seeking the wealth of others, but about seeking your own wealth.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[After a period of internship in the Sales of business, I have gained many values that the business department brings.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With a background in economics, doing an internship early on has always been a &#8220;thorny issue&#8221; for me when I first stepped into the university environment. After a first semester of being aimless and directionless, I was determined to do an internship in the second semester. Anything office-related would do as I was so &#8220;thirsty&#8221; for experience. I chose to intern in the sales departments  because as an economics student, I firmly believe that it would be difficult for me to produce any goods. Skills in marketing and product circulation would be most suitable and help me develop in the long term.</p>



<p>So what values that sales departments have I gained during my time with the company and the job?</p>



<div class="wp-block-rank-math-toc-block" id="rank-math-toc" id="rank-math-toc"><h2>Mục Lục</h2><nav><ul><li ><a href="#1-sales-experience">1. Sales experience</a><ul><li ><a href="#1-1-professional-skills">1.1. Professional Skills:</a></li><li ><a href="#1-2-soft-skills">1.2. Soft skills:</a></li></ul></li><li ><a href="#2-networking">2.

Understanding the industry better instead of being bogged down by prejudices from the past</a></li><li ><a href="#conclusion">*** Conclusion </a></li></ul></nav></div>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-sales-experience"><strong>1. Sales experience</strong></h2>



<p>Experience is surely the top priority for every student, and I am no exception. I was so eager for experience that I went to many places to apply for unpaid internships in exchange for the guidance from more experienced people. Naturally, I was rejected many times, but fortunately, I ended up where I am working now.</p>



<p>Professional skills and soft skills are two core values that I receive:</p>



<div id="1-1-professional-skills" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-1-professional-skills">1.1. <strong><strong>Professional Skills:</strong></strong></h3>



<p>The sales position teaches me practical knowledge and a deeper understanding than what is taught in the &#8220;Business Management&#8221; and &#8220;Basic Marketing&#8221; books. It&#8217;s completely different from just reading and feeling vague and distant when not working.</p>



<p>Working experience also helps me understand more about the enterprise, how the business operates, and gain a basic understanding of the work of different departments within the company.</p>



<p>I have been studying human analysis tools such as numerology, DISC, … to gain a deeper understanding and improve myself, as well as to advise and support customers in guiding and overcoming difficulties in learning, and life issues.</p>



<p>I have the opportunity to learn about and get involved in Marketing, a field that I have always liked and nurtured for a long time.</p>



<div id="1-2-soft-skills" class="index-title"></div><h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-2-soft-skills">1.2. <strong><strong>Soft skills:</strong></strong></h3>



<p><strong>+ Communication</strong>: I have improved my communication skills through conversations with clients, managers, and colleagues. My job has pushed me to step out of my comfort zone, actively connect and engage. Communication is an art, skillful communication will support me and my colleagues in work and life, as my boss once taught me &#8220;the mouth helps the hands and feet&#8221;, truly impressive and revealing. Not only in work negotiations, but also in personal relationships such as family, friends, and partners, I have learned to regulate emotions, communicate skillfully to discuss issues and find solutions as well as general communication, instead of having to endure or create conversations that end in arguments and toxicity.</p>



<p><strong>+ Self-management: </strong>Unlike the dull energy lying in dorm room 1, scrolling through the phone all day, when I go to work, interact with the new environment, new friends, and new colleagues, I feel the energy of everyone, also &#8220;absorb&#8221; excitement and consciously push myself to study well, manage time.</p>



<p><strong>+ Time management:</strong>&nbsp;It&#8217;s still a story from semester 1, studying only 4 subjects but always feeling lacking and suffocated, all because of too much free time and laziness, &#8220;spending time on useless things and lacking time for necessary things.&#8221; Until starting to work, meeting those senior colleagues, those friends who also balanced study and work very well, received scholarships regularly every semester, won in various competitions, only then did I feel the pressure to arrange and be aware of studying to not fall behind. Now, I not only make a to-do list for each day, but also need to plan for the whole month, also thankful for the nature of the job that helped me learn how to improve myself.</p>



<p><strong>+</strong> <strong>Gratitude:</strong>&nbsp;Before going to work, I was involved in a volunteer club and initially felt overwhelmed by the strict rules. However, when I started working, learning about gratitude culture and expressing thanks, I became much more proactive, showing more gratitude and admiration for those who have led and taught me. I learned the mindset of &#8220;an empty cup,&#8221; accepting the teachings of others rather than acting like &#8220;I already know half of it,&#8221; as in the past.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-networking"><strong>2. Networking</strong></h2>



<p>I am connected and working with experienced mentors, both in work and life, people that I would never have the chance to contact if I didn&#8217;t go to work.</p>



<p>I have added truly quality and sustainable relationships when accompanying each other in work and development, those who are willing to listen and help when I need, those intimate &#8220;boards of directors&#8221; like family.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-salary"><strong>3. Salary</strong></h2>



<p>I receive a salary that matches my dedication, and going to work early makes me value money early, value my parents&#8217; labor, and spend more reasonably.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="4-understanding-the-industry-better-instead-of-being-bogged-down-by-prejudices-from-the-past"><strong>4. Understanding the industry better instead of being bogged down by prejudices from the past</strong></h2>



<p>Employees of the sales department, the name of this position is Sale. Most people have stereotypes about sales, and I was like that too, but I decided to try it out to see what really suits me, and I have received a lot of values like the above &#8211; something that if I just stick with a biased mindset, I will never receive.</p>



<p>Sales is an essential part of business, and being a best seller is highly valuable in the eyes of employers. From my experience, there is no bad industry; every profession is worthwhile and contributes to social development. The difference lies in each person&#8217;s way of working. Being a caring salesperson, accompanying and supporting customers throughout the use of the service or product, to help them achieve the best results, is a very humane job. My quality networking includes not only colleagues and bosses, but also the customers I have advised and supported.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion">*** <strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After nearly 1 year of perseverance, I went from being an Intern to a Supervisor. I am grateful to the colleague who guided me to this job, thankful for the mentors who provided guidance and instruction, appreciative of the teammates who worked alongside me to achieve our goals, and thankful to myself for persevering without giving up.</p>



<p>If you are also an economist, then the position in the business department is worth applying for and experiencing as well as developing yourself.</p>
